# Neuropsychologia2018

All of the scripts used in Barry-Anwar et al 2018.

Data was recorded in Netstation. All analyses were carried out in Matlab/eeglab.

1. Step1: ELFI_dataprocessing_Conditions_Final.m filters the data and segments based on the type of trial. (PreMacaque.txt and PreCapuchin.txt are bin files for segmenting here). This script requires data to be saved as .set and .fdt files.
